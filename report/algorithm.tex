\section{Algorithm}

Our main goal is to investigate the sample complexity dynamics of learning a relation classification task in a multi-task learning setting when the data available for the target task is limited. To this end, we compare the generalization error of a deep learning model trained only on SemEval 2010 Task 8, the target task, with the generalization error of a deep learning model trained jointly on the SemEval data and one of the auxiliary tasks described in \ref{auxiliary_tasks}.
\\\\
We proceed as follows: We vary the amount of data from the target task by a set of fractions. For every fraction $f$ we perform 5-fold cross validation on the target data to yield 5 macro F1 scores. We use the training data from the 4 training folds of target data and the auxiliary data to train the architectures described in \ref{network_architecture}. We use an algorithm similar to \citet{mou2016} and \citet{bingel2017}: We uniformly select one of the two tasks, sample a mini-batch from the training data of that task, and perform one gradient descent update with respect to cross-entropy error using the Adam algorithm described in section \ref{adam}.
\\\\
This process is iterated until an early stopping criterion on a target task validation set is met. Specifically, $1/10$ of target training data is set aside for early stopping validation. Training is halted when the cross-entropy error on the early stopping dataset has not improved for 200 iterations of mini-batch gradient descent. Finally, the model weights are reset to their best recorded value.

When the patience is exceeded we record the cross-validation macro-F1 on the target task test fold using the best recorded weights. Since neural network training is a random search procedure with respect to weight initialization and mini-batch sampling we run this experiment for each fraction $f$ 5 times, yielding a total of 25 random cross-validation splits. We have provided the algorithm used in our experiments as pseudocode in algorithm \ref{experiment_pseudocode}. The code can be downloaded at \texttt{github.com/suned/thesis}.
