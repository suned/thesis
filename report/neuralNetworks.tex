\chapter{Neural Networks}
\label{neural_networks}

In this part we describe how to define $\mathcal{H}$ using functions called \textbf{neural networks}. One advantage of these functions is that they're easy to adapt to multi-task learning. We begin by describing how to design $\mathcal{H}$ using neural networks. We then turn to the issue of how to use $\mathcal{D}$ to search this hypothesis space. We then cover regularization techniques, the purpose of which are to prevent overfitting. Lastly, we introduce convolutional neural networks which are specialized functions often used for text classification problems such as relation extraction.
