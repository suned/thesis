\chapter{Neural Networks}
\label{neural_networks}

In this part we describe how to define $\mathcal{H}$ using functions called \textbf{neural networks}. These functions have the advantage of being easy to adapt to multi-task learning. We begin by describing how to design a $\mathcal{H}$ with neural networks. We then turn to the issue of how to use $\mathcal{D}$ to search this hypothesis space. Lastly, we introduce specialised neural networks that are useful for natural language processing.
