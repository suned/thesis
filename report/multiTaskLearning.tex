\chapter{Multi-Task Learning}
\label{multi-task_learning}
In this section we introduce an extension to the supervised machine learning framework called multi-task learning. We first cover the main ideas and motivation for multi-task learning. We then summarize different variations on statistical learning theory to gain an intuition of how and when multi-task learning works. Finally, we describe how to implement multi-task learning with neural networks.
