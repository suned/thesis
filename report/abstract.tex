\textit{In this thesis we investigate the usefulness of a multi-task, convolutional neural network architecture relation classification. We review the relevant theoretical and practical research literature for relation classification, supervised machine learning, convolutional neural networks, and deep multi-task learning. We test a state-of-the-art multi-task convolutional neural network architecture designed for relation classification on the SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset. We investigate the sample complexity dynamics of learning this task simultaneously with other natural language processing tasks. We find that the architecture is ill-suited for this purpose. We discuss alternative approaches and make recommendations for further experimentation in this direction.}
