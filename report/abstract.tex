\textit{In this thesis we investigate the usefulness of a multi-task convolutional neural network architecture for relation classification. We review the relevant theoretical and practical research literature for supervised machine learning, convolutional neural networks, deep multi-task learning and relation classification. We test a state-of-the-art multi-task neural network architecture designed for relation classification on the SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset, and investigate the sample complexity dynamics of learning this task simultaneously with other natural language processing tasks. We find that the convolutional architecture is ill-suited for this purpose. We discuss alternative approaches and make recommendations for further experimentation in this direction.}
