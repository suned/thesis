\chapter{Experiment}
In this section we explain our experimentation with multi-task learning for relation classification. We begin by describing related work on deep multi-task learning for natural language processing tasks and relation extraction. Our focus is to investigate the impact of multi-task learning on generalization error on a target task introduced in the first section. We continue by describing each auxiliary task. Finally, we describe the neural network architecture and algorithm used for generating empirical data.
