\chapter{Results}
In this section we present the results obtained in the experiment detailed in the previous sections. We visualize the $F1$ scores obtained for each auxiliary task and weight sharing strategy described in section \ref{network_architecture}. Specifically, we plot the mean macro $F1$ over cross-validation folds of the target data as a function of the fraction $f$ when the target task is learnt in a single-task and multi-task setting. This leads to two so called \textbf{learning curves} for each experiment that indicates how generalization error as approximated by cross-validation varies with respect to target data set size and auxiliary task.
\\\\
Moreover, we perform a one-sided statistical significance test
