\section{Problem Statement}
In this thesis we investigate multi-task learning for information extraction. We focus on an information extraction task called relation classification using deep multi-task learning techniques. Specifically:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We will survey the relevant research literature in order to formally answer questions such as \textit{when is multi-task learning beneficial? How can we evaluate the usefulness of an auxiliary task?}
	\item We will apply our theoretical understanding by analysing a deep multi-task learning system for relation classification, in order to make predictions about its performance.
	\item We implement a deep multi-task learning relation classification system based on our analysis.
	\item We empirically test our predictions about the system's performance using appropriate accuracy measures.
\end{enumerate}
