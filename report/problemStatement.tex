\section{Problem Statement}
In this thesis we investigate multi-task learning for relation extraction. We focus on the relation classification sub-problem using deep learning techniques. Our goal is to investigate how the performance of a deep learning system trained on an auxiliary and target task simultaneously compares to a system trained only on the target task when the available data for this task is limited. Specifically:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We survey the relevant research literature in order to formally answer questions such as \textit{when is multi-task learning beneficial? How can we evaluate the usefulness of an auxiliary task?}
	\item We implement a deep multi-task learning relation classification system based on our research.
	\item We apply our theoretical understanding by analyzing our deep multi-task learning system for relation classification in order to make predictions about its performance.
	\item We empirically test our predictions about the system's performance using appropriate accuracy measures.
\end{enumerate}
