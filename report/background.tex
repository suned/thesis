In this part, we exemplify the information extraction problem and formally describe the supervised machine learning and multi-task learning setting. In addition, we describe neural networks, the concept of representation learning and its relevance to multi-task learning.

\section{Summary}
In this section we have seen that the purpose of named entity recognition is to identify mentions of entities such as people, organisations and places in natural language. The purpose of relation extraction systems is to identify relationships between them. 

We have seen that simple accuracy is uninformative as an evaluation measure in information extraction, and described the alternative precision and recall.

We have described the formal setting of on supervised machine learning. We have discussed concepts such as overfitting and noise, diversity of the set of functions $\mathcal{H}$ from which to choose $h$, and its impact on training and generalisation error.
