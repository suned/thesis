\label{background}

In this part, we describe the information extraction problem and the challenges it poses. Moreover, we formally describe the supervised machine learning setting. Specifically, we discuss the challenges of noise and overfitting, and show the usefulness of Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis.

\section{Summary}
In this section we have seen that the purpose of named entity recognition is to identify mentions of entities such as people, organisations and places in natural language. The purpose of relation extraction systems is to identify relationships between them. 

We have seen that simple accuracy is uninformative as an evaluation measure in information extraction, and described the alternative precision and recall.

We have described the formal setting of on supervised machine learning. We have discussed concepts such as overfitting and noise, diversity of the set of functions $\mathcal{H}$ from which to choose $h$, and its impact on training and generalisation error.
